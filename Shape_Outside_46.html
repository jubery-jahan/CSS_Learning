 The daisy looks like a simple flower, but it is actually a composite of several different
 parts joining to form the flower. Although many insects visit the flower each day, 
the daisy is not bothered by any of them. Generally, a daisy is white with a yellow center,
 although sometimes it can be pink or a rose color. Throughout history, the daisy has been
 featured in myth, literary works and legend. The name originates from the Anglo Saxon word
 meaning "day's eye." The name is appropriate since the flower opens in the morning.
The middle of the flower is known as the central disk, which houses the disk florets. 
The petals are called the ray florets or rays. The stems have no leaves and support only 
one flower, but the plant itself has flower stalks of 3 to 4 inches. Depending on the variety, 
the leaves of the daisy can be smooth or hairy.Some descriptive names for the daisy are moon flower, 
Saint John's flower, moon pennies, Mary's Star, Mary's flower of God and priest's collar. The Shasta
 and the African daisies are the most popular; however, there are several other types.
 Some interesting varieties are the Spanish daisy, blue daisy, and lazy daisy, also known as the prairie daisy
In the language of herbs, a daisy represents innocence, simplicity, cheerfulness, sympathy and a newborn baby.
 In the spring, if a dreamer dreams of daisies, this symbolizes months of good luck. If a person sends daisies, it means "loyal love."
Daisies in Literature
Daisies are third in literary popularity with famous authors. Following the rose and the lily, the daisy appears in
 the works of Euripides, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Robert Burns, Ben Johnson, Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charles Dickens, 
John Keats and many more. A famous quote by Keats on his deathbed was the origin of the expression "pushing up daisies."
 Goethe immortalized the daisy when Marguerite needed to know if Faust loved her as she plucked the daisy petals and said,
 "He loves me. He loves me not."The daisy received its scientific name, Bellis, from mythology. The guardian deity of the
 orchards pursued a young tree nymph without reciprocation. The nymph asked the gods for help in her flight from her 
undesirable pursuer. The powerful king of Argos was grandfather to the nymph, so when she appealed to the gods for help, 
they transformed her into a tiny flower named Bellis, and she escaped a terrible fate.
