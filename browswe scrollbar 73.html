The importance of Computer Science and Information Technology cannot be 
exagerated. We have to have the blessing of this technology and in fact,
 we are rapidly becoming dependent on it. We have to educate and equip our 
young generation with memory skill to face the challenges of the 21st century
. UODA has designed a 4-year undergraduate program in Bachelor of Computer
 Science and Engineering (CSE) to develop professional skills in these fields. 
The program will provide the basics of Computer Programming, Computer Engineering,
 and Information System together with Mathematics, Basic Science, Languages,
