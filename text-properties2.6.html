<h1> Text Formatting</h1></br>
<p>Formatted text is text that is displayed in a special, specified style. ... Text formatting data may be qualitative
 (e.g., font family), or quantitative (e.g., font size, or color).
 It may also indicate a style of emphasis (e.g., boldface, or italics), or a style of notation (e.g., strikethrough, or superscript).
Formatting text in Microsoft Word refers to controlling how text appears in your document. This includes the size, color, and font of the text.
 It also covers text alignment,
 spacing, and letter case. Microsoft Word styles make it easy to change and apply styles throughout a document. 
Word deals with formatting on three levels encompassing small and specific on up to big and broadâ€”through characters,
 paragraphs, and sections. You apply different types of formatting to each of these parts.
 Character formatting includes selecting a font, a font size, bold or italics, and<a href="#"> so on.</a>
