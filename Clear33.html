A novel within a novel, The Forty Rules of Love tells
 two parallel stories that mirror each other across two 
very different cultures and seven intervening centuries.
Forty-year-old Ella Rubenstein is an ordinary unhappy 
housewife with three children and an unfaithful husband, 
but her life begins to change dramatically when she takes
 a job as a reader for a literary agency.. Initially
 reluctant to take on a book about a time and place so different from her own,
 Ella soon finds herself captivated both by the novel and the man who wrote it,
 with whom she begins an e-mail flirtation. As she reads, she begins to question
 the many ways she has settled for a conventional life devoid of passion and real love.
